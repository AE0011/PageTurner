PageTurner Synchronizing e-book reader for Android.

In short, PageTurner is an epub reader that allows you to keep your reading progress synchronized across multuple devices. This means you can read a few pages on your phone, than grab your tablet and continue where you left off.

See http://www.pageturner-reader.org/ for more info and some screenshots.

Building
========

To build PageTurner, you will need Apache Maven 3 (http://maven.apache.org/download.html) instead of Ant.

See http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/wiki/GettingStarted for more info about getting a working setup for building Android apps with Maven.

PageTurner uses a repository which is accessed through HTTPS using a self-signed certificate. 
A trust-store is included in trust.jks, password 'pageturner'

To use it set the MAVEN_OPTS environment option or change your .mavenrc file:

MAVEN_OPTS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=trust.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=pageturner"

See http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-repository-ssl.html for more details.


Eclipse
=======

You can either use the Maven Eclipse and Maven Eclipse Android plugin

OR

follow these steps:

 1. Download and unpack the sources
        
 2. Run
        
      mvn -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=trust.jks 
       -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=pageturner
       -DexcludeTransitive=true
        dependency:copy-dependencies
        
      inside the source folder
        
 3. Create a libs folder
 
 4. Copy everything in target/dependency to the libs folder
 
 5. In Eclipse, select "New Android Project" -> "From existing source" and
    point it to the folder you unpacked PageTurner in.
        
Essentially this completely leaves Maven out of the game, except to get the dependencies.
