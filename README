PageTurner Synchronizing e-book reader for Android.

In short, PageTurner is an epub reader that allows you to keep your reading progress synchronized across multuple devices. This means you can read a few pages on your phone, than grab your tablet and continue where you left off.

See http://www.pageturner-reader.org/ for more info and some screenshots.

Building
========

To build PageTurner, you will need Apache Maven 3 (http://maven.apache.org/download.html) instead of Ant.

See http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/wiki/GettingStarted for more info about getting a working setup for building Android apps with Maven.

PageTurner uses a repository which is accessed through HTTPS using a self-signed certificate. 
A trust-store is included in trust.jks, password 'pageturner'

To use it set the MAVEN_OPTS environment option or change your .mavenrc file:

MAVEN_OPTS="-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=trust.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=pageturner"

See http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-repository-ssl.html for more details.


Eclipse
=======

You can use

mvn eclipse:eclipse

to generate an Eclipse configuration, but this tends to put too many jars on the build path, causing problems.

You only need the following jar files on your Eclipse build path:

guice-2.0-no_aop.jar
htmlcleaner-2.2.jar
epublib-core-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
roboguice-1.1.jar
slf4j-android-1.6.1.jar
acra-4.2.3.jar
